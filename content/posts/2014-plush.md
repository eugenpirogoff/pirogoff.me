 Plush is a game controller made with conductive fabric based on an [adafruit flora project](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit_flora_game_controller). It uses the CapPin Library to measure conductivity between the GPIO pins that runs through the conductive threads and fabrics. This project is especially fun to use with some old emulators and retro games. :-)
